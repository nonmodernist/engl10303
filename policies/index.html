<p>On this page, you&rsquo;ll find the answer to any question you might have about our course. You can use <kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (on Windows) or <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (on Mac) to find specific words.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-class-is-this">What kind of class is this?</h3>
<p>ENGL 10303 is an <a href="https://provost.tcu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Course-Component-Types.pdf">LEC</a> class worth 3 credit hours. It fulfills the <a href="https://provost.tcu.edu/faculty-resources/core-curriculum/core-curriculum-students/">LT and HUM core requirements</a>.</p>
<h3 id="when-and-where-is-this-class">When and where is this class?</h3>
<p>Check <a href="http://classes.tcu.edu">TCU Class Search</a> to find this information.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-get-in-touch-with-the-instructor">How can we get in touch with the instructor?</h3>
<p><a href="mailto:a.k.edwards@tcu.edu">Email me</a>. Or stop by <a href="LINK-HERE-TO-D2L">my office hours</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-materials-do-we-need">What materials do we need?</h3>
<p>Plan to spend no more than $50 to rent the 12 films that are required viewing for this class.</p>
<p>Because our class <strong>does not</strong> include a lab for film screenings, you will need to plan to watch all of our assigned films on your own. Most are available on DVD in the library, some are available through various streaming subscriptions, and most are available to rent through YouTube, Amazon, or other VOD platforms. See the <a href="/engl10303/calendar">course calendar</a> for links.</p>
<p>All required reading will be provided; see the <a href="/engl10303/calendar/">course calendar</a> for links. You will need a laptop or reliable, regular access to a computer with internet.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-we-supposed-to-do-or-learn-in-this-class">What are we supposed to do or learn in this class?</h2>
<h3 id="learning-outcomes">Learning outcomes</h3>
<ol>
<li>Students will watch, discuss, and write about films in order to analyze their aesthetic, technological, historical, and ideological content. (HUM)</li>
<li>Students will demonstrate familiarity with one or more disciplinary approaches to the study of film and/as literature (LT); approaches will include close reading, visual analysis, and archival research communication.</li>
<li>Students will practice leading discussion in order to improve their facilitation abilities.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-flow-of-the-semester">The &ldquo;flow&rdquo; of the semester</h3>
<p>In this class, we will switch back and forth between reading texts and watching films, and between interactive lectures (primarily led by the instructor) and discussions (primarily led by students). There’s a specific “flow” to the way I’ve designed this:</p>
<ul>
<li>We start with a brief assigned reading that introduces an aspect of film history and explains certain concepts (like genre or censorship). Students read and take notes on this reading outside of class.</li>
<li>Then, in class, we’ll have an interactive lecture where I help break down concepts so you understand them better, and introduce contextual information. Students participate by asking and answering questions and taking notes. Lecture topics are listed on the syllabus in italics.</li>
<li>Students watch a film and take notes on it outside of class. Those who are signed up to lead discussion will collaborate to write questions for their classmates to discuss, using the reading and lecture to help generate ideas.</li>
<li>In the next class, students break up into small groups to discuss the film, using questions provided by the discussion leads. The point here is not to rush to a “correct” answer but rather to experiment with ideas in a collaborative way. After this discussion, we’ll reconvene to talk about what you talked about.</li>
<li>Our written assignments, including quizzes, exams, and a research project, will ask you to <a href="/engl10303/blooms">remember, understand, apply, and analyze</a> what you’ve learned from all of the above steps.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="keys-to-success-in-this-course">Keys to success in this course</h3>
<ul>
<li>Carefully watch assigned films and read assigned readings and take notes</li>
<li>Pay attention and take notes during lectures</li>
<li>Participate in discussions</li>
<li>Ask questions in and out of class</li>
<li>Attend class regularly and punctually</li>
<li>Plan, work, and study proactively (don’t start at the last minute)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-we-use-chatgpt-in-this-class">Can we use ChatGPT in this class?</h3>
<p>No.</p>
<p>In this course, unauthorized and uncredited use of ChatGPT or other generative text engines (so-called “AI”) is considered plagiarism and will be treated as such. Here are some of my reasons for this policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI writing tools do not know the details of our course content. In fact, they don’t “know” much of anything other than what word is statistically more likely to go after the previous word. For this reason alone, they are not appropriate to use in our course, which requires you to <a href="/engl10303/blooms/">remember and understand ideas</a>.</li>
<li>AI writing tools as they currently function are best at creating texts with broad, generalizing ideas. Writing assignments in this class will focus on narrow claims and use of textual and visual evidence. In my experience, students who use AI writing tools have turned in work that does not meet the course requirements.</li>
<li>Questions about their <a href="https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-ai-openai-carbon-emissions-stanford-report-1850288635">environmental impact</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffraikes/2023/04/21/ai-can-be-racist-lets-make-sure-it-works-for-everyone/?sh=6e3c9d032e40">potential for racism</a>, <a href="https://tech.co/news/does-chatgpt-save-my-data">implications for privacy</a>, and <a href="https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/">labor</a> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TTC-EC-CEA-AI-Report-12052022-1.pdf">issues</a> make using AI writing tools more complicated than the conversations about “cheating” or “playing around” with the technology that universities are focused on now. Students should consider how they’ll safeguard their own information/intellectual property and how using AI fits into their values as they choose how to interact with it.</li>
<li>Like other kinds of plagiarism, using AI writing tools without permission is often evidence that a student is struggling in a class more generally—plan now to visit office hours to get assistance and/or ask for an extension, rather than resorting to plagiarism when having difficulty with an assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="is-attendance-required-is-attendance-graded">Is attendance required? Is attendance graded?</h3>
<p>Yes and yes.</p>
<p>Success in this course depends on attending class, taking notes during lectures, and participating in our discussions and activities. See the <a href="/engl10303/assignments/#attendance-grading">assignments page</a> for how attendance will be graded. Please do not send me medical documentation for your absences.</p>
<p>Our <a href="/engl10303/assignments/#quizzes">quizzes</a> and <a href="/engl10303/assignments/#exams">exams</a> will cover material from our assigned viewing, reading, class discussions, and lectures. You are responsible for learning what you missed while absent.</p>
<p>Students who miss quizzes, exams, or in-class assignments (like serving as discussion lead) for <a href="https://deanofstudents.tcu.edu/student-handbook/academic-policies/attendance-expectations-office-absence-policy/">University-excused absences</a> should contact me as soon as possible to reschedule. I generally do not allow students to make up assignments missed due to any other type of absence. If you miss a quiz, you will have the opportunity to earn back those points by <a href="/engl10303/makeup">watching a supplemental film and writing a short response paper</a>.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t email me any medical documentation regarding your absences.</p>
<h2 id="when-is-our-final-exam">When is our final exam?</h2>
<p>Our final exam is scheduled for <mark>TBD</mark>.</p>
<p>Per TCU policy, rescheduling of finals is permitted for 1) graduating seniors whose faculty members must submit final grades by Wednesday 5pm of finals week, 2) students with more than two finals in a 24-hour period rule, and 3) students for whom a final examination conflicts with a major religious holiday or custom. Unless the student is graduating, the exam must be taken during final examination week. Rescheduling a final exercise must be done at least one week prior to the last day of classes.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-we-have-grade-concerns">What if we have grade concerns?</h2>
<p>If you would like to discuss evaluations of assignments or exams, please make an appointment with me no sooner than 24 hours after receiving graded work to ensure adequate time to review my comments and to identify areas of concern. TCU has an <a href="https://deanofstudents.tcu.edu/student-handbook/academic-policies/grade-appeal-procedure/">official grade appeal procedure</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-official-accommodation-policy">What is the official accommodation policy?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Texas Christian University affords students with disabilities reasonable accommodations in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. To be eligible for disability-related academic accommodations, students are required to register with the TCU Office of Student Access and Accommodation and have their requested accommodations evaluated. If approved for accommodations, students are required to discuss their official TCU Notification of Accommodation with their instructors.  Accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="audio-recording-notification">Audio recording notification</h3>
<p>Audio recordings of class lectures may be permitted by the instructor or as an approved disability accommodation through Student Access and Accommodation. Recordings are <strong>not</strong> to be shared with other students, posted to any online forum, or otherwise disseminated.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-tcus-other-official-policies">What are TCU&rsquo;s other official policies?</h2>
<p>TCU provides online access to their <a href="https://cte.tcu.edu/tcu-syllabus-policies/">policies and resources</a>, including support for TCU students, student access and accommodation, anti-discrimination and Title IX information, and other important information.</p>
